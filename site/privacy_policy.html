        <h2>How does Spire Scrims Use My Data?</h2>
        <p>The Spire Scrims bot only collects the bare minimum information about services you consent it to have across the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Discord User ID</li>
            <li>Twitch User ID</li>
            <li>In-Game User Information and Statistics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information is entirely opt-in when you use the bot, and can be opted out at any time. If you wish to download your data, or have it removed from the bot entirely, please contact @lunarecklipse on Discord to begin the process.<br />This data is solely used for the bot to operate by tracking your statistics, as well as other functions such as allowing you to link your in-game account with your Discord and Twitch accounts.</p>
        <h2>How is My Data Stored?</h2>
        <p>Your data is stored in a secure database that is only accessible by the bot's developers. We do not share your data with any third parties, and we do not sell your data to any third parties. Your data is stored for the purpose of providing you with the services you have consented to, and is deleted upon request.</p>
        <h2>How Can I Contact The Developer About Further Questions?</h2>
        <p>If you have any further questions about your data, or how it is used, please contact @lunarecklipse on Discord, or email at spirescrims@lunarecklipse.ca.</p>
        <h2>What about AI?</h2>
        <p>The Spire Scrims bot uses Artificial Intelligence to train an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model to calculate player scores. When images are submitted for processing, they are not stored once they are processed, nor are they used to train the model further. The bot will only use your images to train its model if you <i>explicitly</i> consent to allow the bot to do so, and this consent can be withdrawn at any time. Please note that once images have been used to train the model, the data your images have contributed to the model cannot be removed, but the images themselves can.</p>
